    • What’s a class attribute
    • What’s an instance attribute
    • What are all the ways to create them and what is the Pythonic way of doing it
    • What are the differences between class and instance attributes
    • What are the advantages and drawbacks of each of them
    • How does Python deal with the object and class attributes using the __dict__

This is called the procedure-oriented way of programming. There is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object. This is called the object oriented programming paradigm. Most of the time you can use procedural programming, but when writing large programs or have a problem that is better suited to this method, you can use object oriented programming techniques.
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. An analogy is that you can have variables of type int which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (objects) of the int class.
